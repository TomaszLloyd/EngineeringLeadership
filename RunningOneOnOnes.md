# Running effective one-on-one's with your team

There are several perspectives from which you might find yourself running one-on-ones with your team, whether you’re an Engineering Manager (EM) leading a team of individual contributors (ICs), A Senior Engineering Manager (Sr EM) checking in with your EMs, or you’re a Staff-Plus (E4+) engineer mentoring or coaching another engineer. Regardless of the position you find yourself in, there are a few principles that can guide you in running these effectively. These are not hard and fast rules, but they can serve as a jumping off point.

## One-on-one’s:

These serve two purposes:

1. They create a human connection between you and your manager or direct report
2. And just as importantly, they provide a regular opportunity to speak privately about whatever needs discussing.

These meetings are ***not*** meant to be status updates on work but rather a place for you to build rapport and trust with your direct report and provide direction, coaching, and career progression.

### High-level Overview

Before diving into the details, let’s break down some of the steps in running one-on-ones:

- First, establish the relationship with your direct report by getting to know them, and teasing out the things that they value, and what they're short and long-term career progressions look like.

- Go over your direct reports values, and how they align with their short and long-term career goals and look for opportunities within the organization for those.

- Set expectations on the mentoring relationship

- Based on the long-term goals, work backwards, and see what intermediate steps are required to achieve them. It's OK if your direct report has no long-term goals yet, especially if they are a more junior member on the team. The goal is to work together to map out what a short term career strategy looks like.

- Work together to identify one or two key concepts to work on to progress to the next career level. Focus on these concepts for around one quarter (3 months) and provide constant feedback and opportunities for your direct report to improve in these areas. Trying to identify too many things to work on will lead to no progress on any front, the goal here is a low trajectory to a distant horizon.

These should be done on a regular cadence, typically about once a week for around 30 minutes at a time. Feel free to adjust as long as it's consistent.

## Starting a New Reporting Relationship Off Right

Maybe you’ve taken over reporting for a new team member or you have a new hire, how do you get to know this person quickly so you can manage them best?

**First Conversation**: Life Story and the Things That Make People Tick

As your direct report tells you about their life, pay careful attention to their choices, decisions, pivot points, identifying patters and common themes. You should be able to tease out five to ten “core values” and articulate them and the evidence for them back to your direct report. This may seem like overkill, why not just ask about their short and long-term goals? As often as not, some people’s long-term vision statements don’t make sense based on what you learn about them through their life story. Perhaps your direct report wants to be in a leadership position of a large organization but you know that they get frustrated with the slowness of large companies.

This conversation can be had in about 45 to 60 minutes but keep in mind that some people may not feel comfortable sharing certain aspects of their life and that’s ok! Most people are pretty guarded at work and this process goes pretty deep. Let’s be sensitive that, at least initially, this could feel intrusive.

Loosely organize the conversation around major periods of time:
- Middle school
- High school
- Undergraduate university (if applicable)
- Earlier career
- Graduate school / previous roles
- Current role

### Questions to think about during this conversation:

- Pre-Career:
    - How did the people around you view education?
    - Anything to share about your family? Siblings? Community?
    - Tell me about your friends.
    - Did you participate in any activities in school? What did you get out of those things? What did you love about them?
    - Describe your high school life
    - Did you work during high school?
    - Why did you choose that university? That major?
    - Why that internship?
    - What did you learn about yourself in college?

- Previous Roles
    - Tell me about your first job - how’d you end up there? Why?
    - Why did you leave? Why did you choose your next company?
    - When was the last time you said “I love my job” or felt that way? Why did you feel that way?
    - What aspects of past jobs have you loved the most?
    - What aspects of past jobs have you hated the most?

- Current Role
    - Why did you come to this company?
    - What do you love about it? What do you hate?
    - What’s the best part of your week?
    - What makes for a great day around here?
    - What kinds of things get pushed to the bottom of your task list?

### Wrapping up

After this conversation, while it’s still fresh, set aside some time (15-30 minutes) and extract five to ten core values based on what you’ve learned. This can be very helpful when mapping against their long-term goals and being able to more clearly map out what their career progression looks like.

**Example:**

When we ask a direct report about their goals, they might say that they want to be the CEO of a large company one day. It's our job to dig into that and ask questions like:
- What kind of company? Medical, military industrial, tech, non-profit, etc
- What size of a company? Startup, mature Series A, enterprise level, etc.

Ask what draws them to the different types of organizations and why they chose a certain company size or market

**Be very specific**

In all likelihood, your direct report might not ever have thought about any of these questions, and this forces, their hand into being more introspective and more clearly articulating what their actual goals are. We want to narrow the swim line as much as possible.

The preceding may seem like a lot. ***It is***. Mentoring and coaching is a big investment but is ultimately extremely rewarding.

## Setting Expectations

When beginning a new relationship with somebody as a mentor, it's important to establish expectations for both parties.

Some helpful topics that you may want to go over before a beginning the mentorship process include getting to know your mentee's expectations and how they like to receive feedback.

I specifically like to begin this process by letting the mentee know that I appreciate any and all feedback they can give me and want to feel comfortable enough to do the same. If they are not comfortable receiving feedback, then unfortunately, there isn't really any room to grow and it sours the relationship. Providing feedback on a consistent basis is a very large investment from the standpoint of the mentor, and the fact that they're willing to do so, shows their willingness to invest in another human being, and that they care.

The example I typically give people is that I've been doing CrossFit for 12 years. When I go to a new gym, if the coaches ignore me and don't give me any feedback on account of how long I’ve been in the sport, I will either ask them specifically to give me feedback or I will stop going to the gym. I'm there to get better and not just have somebody applaud me during a workout. Feedback and coaching is that important.

[TODO] - add more detail, restructure this area

## Common misconceptions, and things to keep in mind
- One and ones are not about you. I can't stress this enough. This is about how you can facilitate the growth and development of your direct report.
- These are **not** a status update on what they're working on
- Respect boundaries when they are presented. If people don't feel comfortable sharing personal aspects of their life, respect to that.
- This is **not** the place to vent about work or your coworkers. We're not encouraging people to talk about others behind their back. If someone comes to you with a problem they're facing with a co-worker, your job is to listen to them and help them come up with a solution. The very next conversation they have should be with the person they're talking about. We want to be solution driven. If a mentee approaches you because they have a problem at work, our role is to begin asking questions and together come up with a solution for these problems.
- This can be a fantastic opportunity to reframe the situation as an opportunity for your mentee to work on their communication and come up with a strategy on how they're going to personally have a conversation with the other person to hopefully reach a resolution.

## Coaching and Feedback

Now that we've sussed out one or two weaknesses that we want to work on, the real fun begins. Look for explicit opportunities for your direct report where they can intentionally approach these opportunities while keeping these concepts in mind.

Example #1:

Situation: You have a direct report who is an individual contributor and wants to be an engineering manager or a staff plus engineer. This person has a great technical aptitude, but has never had opportunities to lead a team or a project.

Opportunities:

Is there a junior member on the team that this person can coach and mentor? This provides an opportunity for them to begin giving back to junior engineers, and scaling their efforts, while freeing up your time from managing that person, and allows you the opportunity of coaching somebody through a mentorship role

Is there an upcoming project that this engineer wants to lead? This provides opportunities for the manager to begin coaching managers as well. You can really dial in on this process by establishing clear expectations before hand as far as what leading a project looks like, communicating with cross functional teams, working directly with a product manager, estimating timelines for work completion, and various other nuances.
