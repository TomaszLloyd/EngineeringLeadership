Overview
What we’re aiming to accomplish and reframing things. Mindset for feedback:

Personal connection: Because I’ve been coaching CrossFit since 2011, whenever I go to a new CrossFit gym I’m more often than not more experienced than the entire coaching staff. If they don’t provide me with coaching and feedback, I won’t return because I’m there to get better. This is how I view the workplace as well. Looking back on previous jobs, the most rewarding ones put me in situations where I was out of my comfort zone, I had to adapt quickly, I had a lot of coaching and feedback and. I was challenged to push harder and do more than I thought possible. When I’m working for an employer that doesn’t challenge me I begin to feel complacent and like I’m not progressing in my career so I won’t stick around. A lot of people think because they don’t have a new role or project that they’re missing opportunities for growth when just as importantly, there are huge opportunities for growth within our current roles if-and-only-if (or iff for the math nerds) we are challenged to exceed expectations.

The most common reaction to hard feedback is defensiveness. Improvement-oriented coaching can feel crappy and threatening. This results in those of us who should be giving feedback often don’t for two reasons (one selfless and one selfish):

We don’t want to make the other person feel bad

We don’t want to deal with the other persons emotional response.

Getting feedback will put you in positions to feel uncomfortable more often, there’s no way around it but effective people management challenges individuals to perform better than they thought they could.

“Managers who are trying to be liked create misery.” “Great leaders… may have gruff, demanding, uncompromising exteriors but deep down inside the great ones have empathy and an unqualified acceptance of the persons who go with their leadership.”

Receiving Feedback
When someone asks to get your perspective on things, this is the Time for you to provide some color to the situation, where somebody might not have enough context, it's not a place for you to be defensive.

They're really only two responses for when somebody gives you feedback:

Thank them

Ask them to help you understand and then thank them

Be very aware of not getting on the defensive, you want to encourage feedback and make it as painless as possible. If you can put yourself in the other persons shoes or you agree with their assessment, own it.

There are few ways to build trust faster than to take responsibility for mistakes even if it’s not your fault.

Two forms:

Improvement or critical feedback

Praise, sometimes known as “continue coaching”

Giving Feedback
Before giving feedback, it's best to already have a relationship established with the person to get a sense of how they receive feedback. They might be fine with getting publicly praised or they might absolutely fear that with a passion knowing this before hand is very helpful when giving positive feedback. Critical feedback should always be given one on one.

Critical Feedback

Account for Risk:

Is this person a retaliator?

 In an ideal situation, you'd be able to establish a relationship with the person you want to give feedback to beforehand.
